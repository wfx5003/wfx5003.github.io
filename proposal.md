### Proposal
1.Project Description- What is the high level idea of your project? This should
be similar to your daily log submission (but could have changed).

For the project, it is to build a community sharing and posting system. On the website, people can invite people to their own community by sharing the specific code.And users can post different kinds of things
like they can trade second-hand goods or post search notice for their lost pets. They can also recruit new friends to their sports team.

2.Project Design- lower-level description.

a.What technologies will you use, how will they integrate?

I will use Spring MVC to build the event listener and event handler, and SQL server management for storing the users' data and information.

b. What are the projectâ€™s use cases?

The people who have been invited to the community can post different kinds of things as they want and looking for. Users can trade second-hand goods or post search notice for their lost pets. They can also recruit new friends to their sports team.

c. Any other design docs that are necessary for me to understand your project

It is similiar to the Reddit and the fisrt topic we mentioned in class.

3.Project Schedule- what will you have done at each checkpoint? What will the
final project look like?

The first checkpoint: finish build the frame structure for the project, like the homepage and UI.

The second checkpoint: create specific functionality and debug.

Final project: a complete community sharing and posting system.

4.Project Justification - why is your project interesting?

a. Novelty - why is your project different than existing applications, and why should people use
it?

In my project each community has a special and unique code to protect and help users control their privacy and security. Users can enjoy the conveniences from the system and avoid strangers who are not living in their community. 

b. Complexity - why is this project a good showcase of your abilities?

This project needs to integrate coding skills with java Spring MVC, SQL databasement, HTML and web design which is a good showcase of my abilities with these.
